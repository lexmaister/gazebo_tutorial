          # Larger P → faster response, but more overshoot/oscillation.
          # 18.0 is a good balance (snappy but still stable).
          p: 18.0
          # Integral gain: corrects small steady-state error (e.g. friction).
          # Keep it small for the gripper to avoid slow oscillations.
          # 3.0 gently pulls the final position into place without dominating.
          i: 3.0
          # Derivative gain: damping term.
          # Helps reduce overshoot and ringing when P and I are active.
          # 0.8 gives noticeable damping for the finger inertia in Gazebo.
          d: 0.8
          # Integral clamp: limit for accumulated integral term.
          # Prevents I from growing too large when the finger is against hard stops.
          # 0.02 means integral can only add a small bias correction.

          # Anti-windup: stop integrating when output is saturated.
          # Essential when using I on a joint that hits limits regularly.
